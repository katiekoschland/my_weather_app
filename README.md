Note: Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (https://) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather.

MVP

As a user,
In order to see the weather in my current location,
I would like to be able to enter a city into a text box.

As a user,
In order to see the weather in my current location,
I would like it to be displayed in Degrees Celsius.

As a user,
In order to see the weather in my current location,
I would also like to to have a different background image depending on the weather.

As a user,
So that I can see the weather in Fahrenheit and Celsius
I would like to see a toggle button that converts the temperature for me.

Styling

As a user,
So that I know it is an FT app,
I would like to be able to see origami styling.

1) Be able to take the text input and store it as the city.
2) Redirect to the /weather route - this will display the weather
3) Have a toggle box to convert the weather from celsius to Fahrenheit
      ((c * 1.8) + 32 = F)
   Origami has it's own checkbox which acts as a toggle in o-forms. So use this.
4) Set up a makefile and have commands like make build run, make watch work.


Extras to learn (- later today or over the weekend)

1) Watch a git tutorial - learn git fetch all, git stash, git branch.

2) Learn about EC2 for AWS, and AWS in general - cloud computing.

3) Really like to complete the FT Tech test and learn how to use their apis and create my own FT.com
