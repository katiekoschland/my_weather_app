Questions to ask on Monday:

1) How do I Set up a makefile and have commands like make build run, make watch work?

2) How do I access the document object? Why does it not work in a js file?


To learn over the weekend:

1) Watch a git tutorial - learn git fetch all, git stash, git branch.

2) Learn about EC2 for AWS, and AWS in general - cloud computing.

3) Launch a wordpress website - using the guide on AWS

4) Go over notes from this week

To be completed:
